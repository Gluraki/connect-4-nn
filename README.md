Trying to get some sort of neural network for connect 4 to run at a decent level

# Report
Version 1: Complete BS

Version 2: works against random play fails to realise it can win or that the oponent is winning
Its current strategy at around 1000 training is just stacking to 4 and hoping the opponent doesnt winn wich is why its so good against random

Version 3: blocks threads sees he can win just not well might fix itself with more training current version is at 1000
blockign works really well just plays like he doenst wanna win
